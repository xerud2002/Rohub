## FAQ Examples (Schema Markup Ready)

**Q: What is a McKenzie Friend?**  
A: A McKenzie Friend is a non-lawyer who assists litigants in person in court. We can attend hearings with you, help prepare bundles, take notes, and provide moral support — but we cannot address the court unless the judge grants rights of audience.

**Q: Do you provide regulated immigration advice?**  
A: No. We provide general information about immigration processes (e.g., EU Settlement Scheme), but we are not OISC-regulated and cannot provide formal immigration advice or representation.

**Q: How much does a vehicle rejection letter cost?**  
A: Our vehicle rejection letters start at £150. This includes a tailored letter referencing the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and your specific circumstances.

**Q: What's included in the free consultation?**  
A: A 15-minute phone or video call to discuss your issue, explain your options, and provide a tailored quote for our services.

**Q: Do you work with solicitors for complex cases?**  
A: Yes. We partner with regulated solicitors (Forest & CO, Optimal Solicitors, ATMLAW, and others) for reserved legal work such as litigation, conveyancing, and regulated advice.
